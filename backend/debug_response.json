{"summary":"{\n  \"summary\": \"In India, tenant rights depend on the **rent agreement** and the **law of the state** where the property is located. There is no single national law governing all tenant rights, but most states have their own **rent control acts** to protect tenants from unfair eviction or excessive rent increases. These acts vary by state, but generally, they ensure that tenants cannot be evicted without proper notice or legal reason, and landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent.\n\n  If you are a tenant in a **private property** (not government or public housing), your rights may include:\n  - **Right to stay** until the lease period ends or until the landlord follows legal eviction procedures.\n  - **Protection against eviction** without valid reasons like non-payment of rent, illegal use of property, or breach of agreement.\n  - **Limits on rent increases**—landlords usually cannot raise rent beyond what is allowed by the state’s rent control act.\n  - **Right to repairs**—if the property is damaged due to natural wear and tear, the landlord may be required to fix it.\n  - **Notice period**—before evicting you, the landlord must give a written notice (usually 1–3 months, depending on the state).\n\n  If you are a tenant in a **government or public housing** (like a **PMAY** or **rented government flat**), additional rules from the **Prohibition of Eviction from Residential Property Act, 1982** (or similar state laws) may apply, such as:\n  - **No eviction without court order**—landlords cannot throw you out without a legal process.\n  - **Right to appeal** if the eviction is unjustified.\n\n  **Important:** If your rent agreement is **not registered**, you may have weaker legal protection. Always check your agreement and the **rent control act of your state** (e.g., **Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999** or **Delhi Rent Control Act, 1995**) for exact rights. If you face harassment or illegal eviction, you can approach the **local rent authority, consumer court, or file a case in civil court** under the relevant state law.\n\n  **Note:** This is a general overview. Tenant rights can differ based on the type of property (residential, commercial), lease terms, and state-specific laws. Always verify with a lawyer or official sources for your exact situation.\",\n\n  \"relevant_law\": [\n    {\n      \"law\": \"State-specific **Rent Control Acts** (e.g., Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999; Delhi Rent Control Act, 1995)\",\n      \"details\": \"These acts protect tenants from unfair eviction and excessive rent hikes.
